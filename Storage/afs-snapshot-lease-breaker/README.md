## Dependencies

This script depends on the following Python packages (see requirements.txt):

- azure-storage-file-share
- azure-identity
- azure-core

## Getting Started - Prerequisites

Before you dive in, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.8–3.12**: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already set up.
2. **Azure Subscription**: An active Azure account with a Storage Account and File Shares containing snapshots.
3. **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to clone the repository.
4. **Azure Permissions**: Ensure your account or identity has the necessary permissions as detailed in the [Permissions](#permissions) section.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/afs-snapshot-lease-breaker.git
    cd afs-snapshot-lease-breaker
    ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Verify Installation**: Ensure Python and pip are installed:

    ```bash
    python --version
    pip --version
    ```

## Usage

Run the script in interactive mode or provide arguments directly via the command line.

### Interactive Mode

**Windows (recommended):**

```bash
py -3.12 afs-snapshot-break-lease.py
```

```bash
python afs-snapshot-break-lease.py
```

The script will prompt for any missing required information:

- Authentication method (1 for Account Key, 2 for Entra ID)
- Storage Account name
- Storage Account Key (if using Account Key)
- File Share name
- Retention cutoff (in days)

### Command-line Arguments

You can provide all necessary parameters directly as command-line arguments for non-interactive execution:

```bash
python afs-snapshot-break-lease.py \
  --account <storage_account_name> \
  --auth <1|2> \
  --key <account_key> \
  --share <file_share_name> \
  --days <retention_days>
```

**Windows (recommended):**

```bash
py -3.12 afs-snapshot-break-lease.py \
    --account <storage_account_name> \
    --auth <1|2> \
    --key <account_key> \
    --share <file_share_name> \
    --days <retention_days>
```

*Note*:

- `--auth`: Use `1` for Account Key, `2` for Entra ID.
- `--key`: This argument is only required if `--auth` is set to `1`.

### Non-interactive / Automation Mode

Use `--non-interactive` to fail fast if required values are missing (ideal for automation):

```bash
python afs-snapshot-break-lease.py --non-interactive --auth 2 --account <storage_account_name> --share <file_share_name> --days 30
```

**Windows (recommended):**

```bash
py -3.12 afs-snapshot-break-lease.py --non-interactive --auth 2 --account <storage_account_name> --share <file_share_name> --days 30
```

### Dry-run Mode

Use `--dry-run` to list snapshots without breaking leases:

```bash
python afs-snapshot-break-lease.py --dry-run --auth 2 --account <storage_account_name> --share <file_share_name> --days 30
```

**Windows (recommended):**

```bash
py -3.12 afs-snapshot-break-lease.py --dry-run --auth 2 --account <storage_account_name> --share <file_share_name> --days 30
```

## Quick Start (Download Only)

If you prefer to download and run without cloning the full repo, download the script and requirements file, then:

**Windows (recommended):**

```bash
py -3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py -3.12 afs-snapshot-break-lease.py
```

**Other OS:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python afs-snapshot-break-lease.py
```

## Authentication Methods

1. **Account Key**:
    - Simple but less secure; ideal for testing or specific automated scenarios where Entra ID is not feasible.
    - Select `1` in interactive mode or use `--auth 1`.
    - Requires providing the Storage Account name and key.

2. **Entra ID (Azure AD)**:
    - Secure, identity-based authentication using `InteractiveBrowserCredential`.
    - Select `2` in interactive mode or use `--auth 2`.
    - Opens a browser for login if needed, providing a secure way to authenticate without handling sensitive keys directly.

## Permissions

The account or identity used to run this script requires permissions to list Azure File Share snapshots and break their leases. The **Storage File Data Privileged Contributor** role is generally considered the most granular role for data plane operations on Azure Files.

However, during testing, it has been observed that the **Storage File Data Privileged Contributor** role might not always provide sufficient permissions for all lease-breaking operations performed by the script. While listing snapshots typically works, there is no option in the Azure Portal to break leases manually — this must be done programmatically. In such cases, the **Storage Account Contributor** role has been found to work. Please be aware that **Storage Account Contributor** grants broader permissions, including management plane access to the storage account, so use it with caution and only if strictly necessary.

To follow the principle of least privilege, assign these roles only at the **specific storage account** or **resource group** level, and avoid broader scopes whenever possible.

## Security Considerations

### Recommendation: Use Entra ID

For optimal security, it is **strongly recommended** to use the Entra ID authentication method (`--auth 2`) whenever possible. This approach has several advantages:

- It avoids handling sensitive storage account keys directly.
- Authentication is handled through a secure, interactive browser login flow managed by Azure.
- It aligns with modern security best practices of using identity-based access over shared secrets.

### Account Key Risks

If you must use the Account Key method (`--auth 1`), be aware of the following security risks:

- **Command-Line Exposure**: Providing the key via the `--key <account_key>` argument is **not recommended**. This may expose the key in your shell's history file and make it visible in your system's process list.
- **Interactive Prompt**: The script has been updated to use a secure interactive prompt that hides the key as it is typed and prevents it from being saved in your shell's history. If you must use the Account Key method, always use the interactive prompt instead of the `--key` argument.

To minimize risk, always prefer Entra ID authentication and ensure the identity has only the necessary permissions, as described in the [Permissions](#permissions) section.

## Example Output

Here’s what you can expect when running the script:

```plaintext
🔐 Authentication: Entra ID (Interactive) | Account: mystorageaccount | Share: myshare | Cutoff days: 30

🔍 Checking snapshots for 'myshare' older than 30 days...

Snapshot                            Status     State      Older?

```

## Troubleshooting

- **ResourceNotFoundError**: Verify the Storage Account name, File Share name, or that the specified snapshot exists.
- **HttpResponseError**: Check your credentials, ensure the identity has the correct permissions (see [Permissions](#permissions)), or verify the Azure service status.
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure `azure-storage-file-share` and `azure-identity` are installed as per the [Installation](#installation) steps.
- **Timestamp Parsing Issues**: The script handles various timestamp formats, but if issues persist, please report them.
**Detailed Errors:** For any failures, check the detailed log file specified at the end of the script’s output (e.g., `Detailed log: /Users/username/snapshot-lease-breaker/error-log.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` on macOS/Linux, or `C:\Users\username\snapshot-lease-breaker\error-log.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` on Windows).
